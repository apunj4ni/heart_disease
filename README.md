Heart Disease Health Indicators Dataset
 Project Outline:

Introduction
Overview of the dataset and its significance
Define the research question, eg., How do various covariates jointly affect the likelihood of stroke, high blood pressure, smoker, and diabetes? 

Data Exploration and Cleaning 
Initial examination of the dataset
Identify missing values and outliers 
Discuss data types and correct any inconsistencies 

Descriptive Statistics
Provide summary statistics for each variable 
Explore distribution of the response variables 

Data Visualization
Create graphs to show relationships between covariates and each response variable.
Use plots like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

Statistical Analysis
Choose appropriate statistical methods to analyze the data.
Model the relationship between covariates and response variables.
Correlation analysis
Regression analysis (Linear regression, logistic regression, multivariate regression)
Cluster analysis
PCA

Model Building/Machine Learning
Develop predictive models for each response variable.
Binary classification
Decision trees, random forests, cross validation

Results
Interpret the findings from the models.
Discuss the impact of different covariates on each response variable.

Conclusion
Summarize the key findings.
Discuss limitations and potential further research.
